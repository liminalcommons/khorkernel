- `.khorkernel/plugins/terraform/plugin.py` - Terraform infrastructure scaffolding plugin
- `.khorkernel/plugins/playwright/plugin.py` - Playwright UI testing plugin

## Feature Implementation Details

1. **Requirements Management**
   - Created `requirements-kernel.txt` with pinned versions for consistent behavior
   - Updated `bootstrap_backlog.py` to check and offer installation of these packages
   - Added fallback behavior when dependencies are missing

2. **Context Schema**
   - Created comprehensive JSON Schema for `.khora/context.yaml`
   - Integrated validation in `gen_context.py` to catch format errors
   - Added pre-commit hook for validation

3. **Bootstrap Resilience**
   - Enhanced error handling for missing/malformed `bootstrap_sprint0.json`
   - Added better detection and helpful messages for GitHub API rate limits
   - Implemented clear progress reporting and error recovery

4. **Plugin Implementation**
   - Created a simple but powerful plugin system in `bootstrap_backlog.py`
   - Built two complete plugins (terraform and playwright)
   - Added documentation on creating custom plugins

5. **CI Enhancement**
   - Implemented a functional context-delta workflow using deepdiff
   - Added detection and highlighting of context changes in PRs
   - Added visualization of knowledge graph changes

6. **Security Enhancements**
   - Added robust `gen_secure_creds.py` for random credential generation
   - Created TruffleHog exclude configuration to reduce false positives
   - Added secure password generation with proper entropy

7. **"Lite-Compose" Profile**
   - Implemented development profile with minimal services
   - Used Docker Compose profiles for conditional service starting
   - Made services for DB and observability optional in lite mode

8. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**
   - Created flexible `render_kg.py` tool with multiple output formats
   - Added table and graph visualization options
   - Implemented relationship detection between concepts and rules

9. **Self-Test Utility**
   - Built `self_test.py` to verify kernel file integrity and functionality
   - Added sandbox testing capability to validate bootstrap process
   - Implemented detailed reporting of test results

10. **Release Notes Generator**
    - Created `gen_release_notes.py` for automated changelog generation
    - Implemented conventional commit parsing
    - Added breaking change detection and highlighting

## Usage

These enhancements maintain backward compatibility while adding significant value. Users can adopt these features incrementally:

1. Start with the basic bootstrap:
   ```bash
   python .khorkernel/scripts/bootstrap_backlog.py
   ```

2. Generate secure credentials:
   ```bash
   python .khorkernel/scripts/gen_secure_creds.py
   ```

3. Use lightweight mode for development:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile lite up
   ```

4. Visualize knowledge graph:
   ```bash
   python .khorkernel/scripts/render_kg.py --format table
   ```

5. Enable plugins in the manifest:
   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - terraform
     - playwright
   ```

The implementation is robust, well-documented, and ready for distribution.
