# Khora Kernel TruffleHog Excludes
# This file contains patterns for excluding false positives from TruffleHog security scans.
# 
# HOW TO USE:
# Add patterns (one per line) to exclude specific paths or files where you know
# the detected "secrets" are actually just examples, test data, or other non-sensitive content.
#
# FORMAT:
# Each line should be a regular expression pattern. Any file path matching the pattern will be skipped.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# tests/fixtures/.*          # Skip all files in tests/fixtures directory
# .*\.example$               # Skip files with .example extension
# docs/samples/config\.json  # Skip a specific file
#
# NOTE: Be careful not to exclude actual secrets! Only add patterns for known false positives.
# See https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog for more details on pattern syntax.
